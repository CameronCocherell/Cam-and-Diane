    <p>My love,</p>

    <p>From the moment you became a part of my life, everything changed in ways I never imagined. You’ve been my safe place, my laughter in the quiet, my comfort when the world feels too heavy. Being with you doesn’t just make life better — it makes it feel whole.</p>

    <p>I don’t love you in a small or passing way. I love you in a way that’s steady, certain, and unshakable. I love you in the little things — in the way you smile, the way your voice makes me feel at home, the way you look at me like I matter. And I love you in the big ways — in the life we dream about, the trust we’ve built, and the future I can’t help but see with you in it.</p>

    <p>You are my best friend, my favorite person, and my greatest adventure. You’re the one I want to share every good thing with, the one I need beside me in the hard moments, and the one who makes even the smallest moments unforgettable just by being there.</p>

    <p>If I could give you the world, I would — but my heart is the most precious thing I have, and it’s already yours. Always has been. Always will be.</p>

    <p>For today, for tomorrow, and for every day after, I’m yours. My love for you is forever.</p>

    <p>Forever and always,<br>Cam ❤️</p>
