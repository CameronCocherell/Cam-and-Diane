    <h1>My Love, My Diane</h1>
    <p>From the moment you came into my life, everything felt different. You’ve been my joy, my safe place, my favorite part of every day. Your smile can turn the darkest moment into light, your laugh is the sweetest melody I’ve ever known, and your love has been the greatest gift I could ever receive. I love you not just for who you are, but for how you make me feel—seen, understood, and truly cherished.</p>
    <p>Through every up and down, through every laugh and every tear, I’ve loved you with every part of my heart. And no matter where life takes us, you’ll always be the one I think of first in the morning and last at night. You are my best friend, my partner, my greatest love. Always and forever, it’s you.</p>
